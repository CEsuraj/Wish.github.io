Amazing and beautiful,<br>
not a flower or a tree.<br>
Much prettier than that,<br>
and only I can see.<br>
<br>
Loving and caring <br>
right down to the core. <br>
Filling me with happiness <br>
and so much more.<br>
<br>
Eyes are so stunning,<br>
cannot look away.<br>
Gorgeous and shining <br>
all throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Here in your arms <br>
is where I belong. <br>
The beating of your heart <br>
is like a beautiful song. <br>
